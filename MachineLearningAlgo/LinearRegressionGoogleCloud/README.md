Regression in statistics is the process of predicting a Label(or Dependent Variable) based on the features(Independent Variables) at hand. Regression is used for time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables and forecasting. For example, the relationship between the stock prices of the company and various factors like customer reputation and company annual performance etc. can be studied using regression.

Regression analysis is an important tool for analysing and modelling data. Here, we fit a curve/line to the data points, in such a manner that the differences between the distance of the actual data points from the plotted curve/line is minimum. The topic will be explained in detail in the coming sections.

Linear Regression
Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental and widely known Machine Learning Algorithms which people start with. Building blocks of a Linear Regression Model are:

Discreet/continuous independent variables

A best-fit regression line

Continuous dependent variable. i.e., A Linear Regression model predicts the dependent variable using a regression line based on the independent variables. The equation of the Linear Regression is:

                                          Y=a+b*X + e 
Where, a is the intercept, b is the slope of the line, and e is the error term. The equation above is used to predict the value of the target variable based on the given predictor variable(s).


The Problem statement:
This data is about the amount spent on advertising through different channels like TV, Radio and Newspaper. The goal is to predict how the expense on each channel affects the sales and is there a way to optimise that sale?

it is implemented and deployed in cloud.
