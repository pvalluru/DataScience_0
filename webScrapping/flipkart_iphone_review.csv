Ultimate beast of 2017. #iPhoneX,5,As always awesome quality from Apple. Neural Engine on A11 bionic processor really kept up its hype. Face ID is fast and convenient There will be a learning curve to get used to the new Gestures but it wont take more than a couple of hours Wish Apple could have included a 60hz display. But I would blame Samsung for that for pricing the current display at higher than the usual price when supplying to Apple and restricting them to go for a higher refresh rate display like on iPad ProNo re...,Anirudh Pulikonda,"Certified Buyer, Nellore","Dec, 2017",0,2

Early Impressions of World's Most Awaited Device - iPhone X,5,"Okay, so here it is... iPhone X (it's 10 - TEN and not 'Ex' or 'X'). Before I jump to iPhone X, let me quickly comment on Flipkart's service. They delivered before the date committed (6th Nov was scheduled date whereas product received on 5th Nov itself). While delivery was scheduled for 6th Nov, fans/early adopters do expect launch day delivery and thus it would be appreciated if Flipkart can plan the same accordingly to reach all the pre-order on launch day or a day later than 2 days+. Also...",Purav Mehta,"Certified Buyer, Mumbai","Nov, 2017",24,32

"""Top notch""!",5,Mind blowing! That's how I would describe my experience with the iPhone X.Those planning to shift from Android will come to know the beauty of software & hardware integration.The phone functions seamlessly. It's battery can last 12-14 hours if graphics intensive games are avoided and the loudspeaker use kept to minimum.Currently there is a difference of 13K INR between 64GB & 256GB models. I would definitely recommend the 264GB model as one can do limitless things with this phone.Cameras ...,Bhagyesh Kshire,"Certified Buyer, Mulund Mumbai","Nov, 2017",5,2

Worth it!,5,I used the iPhone 7 before this. With so many conflicting reviews I was unsure how the Device would be.

Box office HIT,5,"X loses its home button. Honestly, even the thought was life disruptive since I have been using the iPhones in the last decade.

If u are a large screen fan, you may still want to wait till Oct 2018 wherein Apple may release a bigger ver of X.The Phone is overall a HIT",Flipkart Customer,"Certified Buyer, Mumbai","Dec, 2017",4,7
